* ###Problem  
Duplication of the World's first website
* ###Solution
  * Method  
    * We separated our project in 3. We first worked on the yahoo-news.html and we separated the css work of the page in three.
      Everyone was then assign a page to work on, by themselves. I worked on the yahoo-coronavirus.html and its css file.
    * Everyone created their own files and branch. We merged as much as possible together. I had technical difficulties because I don't have enough memory to open the clone of the repository the Deborah created.
    members created their branches and we merged our files together.
    * The final work will be posted on vercel.
  * Process
    * PHPStorm
